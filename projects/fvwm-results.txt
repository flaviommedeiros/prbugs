    2012-01-26  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/events.c (HandlePropertyNotify):
    	Rather than tracking whether the icon name has been assigned or not, now
    	also do this on _XA_WM_NAME when the icon title is not the same as the
    	window title; since the ordering of events is not guaranteed to be processed
    	correctly,
    
    2012-01-18  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* README:
    	Update for 2.6.X release, but generalise on the actual version of FVWM
    	so that generic documents such as this do not need updating as often.
    
    2012-01-02  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/ConfigFvwmDefaults:
    	Make BusyCursor Wait True, and give a CursorStyle of dot.
    
    	This gives a visual clue when generating fvwm-menu-desktop, for
    	instance via PipeRead which might take some time.
    
    2011-12-19  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* bin/fvwm-menu-desktop.in:
    	Add back "/usr/share/applications" to the list in

    2011-10-15  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/frame.c (frame_free_move_resize_args):
    	Don't restore the client's gravity.
    
    	There might be a chance some clients with a gravity other than Static
    	(such as non-NW gravity) might not react well -- but setting the gravity
    	to the main window hint will break clients being remapped as subwindows,
    	c.f. XEmbed.

    	Update key files for 2.6.3 release.
    
    2011-09-26  Chris Siebenmann <cks-fvwm@cs.toronto.edu>
    	* fvwm/add_window.c (interpolate_titleformat_name):
    	* fvwm/style.c (__validate_titleformat_string):
    	Add '%i' format for IconTitleFormat/TitleFormat
    
    	This inserts the window's icon name. There are some applications
    	that update only their icon name, not their title.
    
    2011-09-10  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/ewmh.c (ewmh_HandleNotification):
    	* fvwm/ewmh_intern.h:
    	* fvwm/fvwm.h:
    	Support _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION
    
    	Applications such as xfce4-notifyd do not explicitly set
    	override_redirect, but do set
    	_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION -- so fvwm should also handle this by
    	marking such windows as unmanaged.
    
    2011-08-30  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/placement.c (__place_window):
    	Don't assume PositionPlacement can modify EWMH working area
    
    	Because PositionPlacement uses the same mechanics as the Move command,
    	and this now has the ability to check for the EWMH working area via
    	"ewmhiwa", etc., let that modify it for us if the option is given.
    
    	This makes things like the following possible:
    
    		Style teddybear PositionPlacement screen 1 0p 0p ewmhiwa
    
    2011-08-28  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/ewmh.c (EWMH_fullscreen):
    	Add "ewmhiwa" option when a client goes fullscreen
    
    2011-08-28  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* libs/FScreen.c (FScreenOfPointerXY):
    	* libs/FScreen.h:
    	Introduce wrapper around static function FindScreenOfXY() to determine
    	which screen the pointer is on, and return it as something which can be
    	used through parameter expansion (presumably in configs?)
    
    	* fvwm/expand.c (expand_vars_extended):
    	Expand VAR_POINTER_SCREEN.
    
    2011-08-28  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (GetMoveArguments):
    	Add ewmhiwa option
    
    	As with the Maximize command, the coordinates of the Move command can be
    	told to ignore the working area.  The default is to honour it, again as
    	with the Maximize command.
    
    2011-08-15  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (__resize_window):
    	Add support code for warping/direction.
    
    	Adds the code which ensures, based on the new warptoborder/direction
    	logic that the various logic is handled at the correct time.
    
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (__resize_get_dir_from_window):
    	__resize_dir_get_proximity() to include warp coords
    
    	In working out which direction a window should be moved in, ensure we also
    	set the coordinates for where the pointer should be warped to, if it's been
    	requested that the pointer should be warped to the closest border
    	automatically.
    
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (GetResizeArguments):
    	Add "automatic" option to resize arguments
    
    	Both the "direction" and "warptoborder" sub-commands of Resize, can now
    	optionally accept the option "automatic" which will attempt to work out
    	which region of the window the pointer is in, and set the direction based on
    	it.
    
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (__resize_get_dir_from_resize_quadrant):
    	Introduce __resize_get_dir_from_resize_quadrant()
    
    	In order to work out the direction to warp the pointer to automatically, as
    	well as setting the direction automatically, this helper function will
    	return the direction the pointer is in, based on the quadrant of the window.
    
    2011-08-15  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/style.c (__validate_titleformat_string):
    	New helper function for validating TitleFormat and IconTitleFormat
    	commands.
    
    	* fvwm/style.c:
    	* fvwm/style.h:
    	Introduce TitleFormat and IconTitleFormat style commands.  These
    	effectively deprecate:
    
    	IndexedWindowName
    	IndexedIconName
    	ExactWindowName
    	ExactIconName
    
    	* fvwm/add_window.c (interpolate_titleformat_name):
    	Helper function to interpolate and parse the TitleFormat and
    	IconTitleFormat string.
    
    	* fvwm/add_window.c (setup_visible_name):
    	Make use of: interpolate_titleformat_name() for setting the
    	visible name of an icon or window title.

    	This removes dead references to variables which were created and never
    	used.  Whilst we could disable the warning completely when compiling, it
    	was a useful chance to remove dead code.
    
    
    2011-08-06  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>

    	  menustyle_parse_style, menustyle_copy):
    	* fvwm/menustyle.h:
    	Add new MenuStyle option "UniqueHotkeyActivatesImmediate"
    
    	This change allows for the hotkey to be pressed on a menu and for it
    	remain open until the user presses one of the keys to enact that
    	specified item.  The default behaviour is the current one of closing the
    	menu and running the action in the case of there being only one entry at
    	the specified hotkey.
    
    2011-07-24  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (unmaximize_fvwm_window):
    	* fvwm/ewmh.c (EWMH_fullscreen):
    	* fvwm/fvwm.h:
    	Fix fullscreen restoring with ResizeHintOverride
    
    	Correctly handle restoring a window whose geometry isn't subject to
    	resize increments when coming out of fullscreen, with respect to that
    	window then being subsequently maximized.
    
    2011-07-18  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (unmaximize_fvwm_window):
    	* fvwm/ewmh.c (EWMH_fullscreen):
    	* fvwm/fvwm.h:
    	Correctly restore windows coming out of fullscreen
    
    	When windows enter into fullscreen, ensure certain attributes of that
    	window -- such as the iconification, maximisation, shading, etc., are
    	tracked and correctly restored when the window leaves fullscreen mode.
    
    	In the case of window maximisation, because fullscreen mode internally
    	uses "ResizeMoveMaximize" to achieve this, the effect of this is to lose
    	the window's maximised state in the interim, because calling
    	ResizeMoveMaximize will remove the maximised state of the window before
    	changing it for its own purposes.
    
    2011-06-11  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/session.c (SaveWindowStates):
    	Don't skip saving window state for windows without WM_COMMAND
    
    	Newer applications (that is, those written before 1821) used to use a
    	nasty hack in the way of the WM_COMMAND XAtom to effectively start the
    	running application.  But this is a crap way of doing it, and the ICCCM
    	even agrees.  Such Atoms have been deprecated for a long time.
    
    	But FVWM uses this file for more than just hints to some other Session
    	Manager -- it's used to reapply state across restarts, and skipping it
    	on the off-chance some session manager might need WM_COMMAND in today's
    	world is silly.
    
    	If a session manager relying soley on WM_COMMAND is being used under
    	FVWM, it won't be honouring many applications anyway, so dropping
    	support for it is fine.
    
    2011-06-04  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* configure.ac:
    	Fix XCursor detection.
    
    	Include the linker libraries if XCursor is found.
    
    2011-04-18    <despen@verizon.net>
    	* fvwm/fvwm.c (SetRCDefaults): Make fvwm-desktop-menu dynamic.

    	* configure.ac:
    	Fix Fribidi library check to use 0.19.2 as a minimum.
    
    2011-04-15  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* libs/FBidi.c (FBidi_convert):
    	Compiler warnings fix.
    	* libs/fsm.c (CompletNewConnectionMsg):
    	Compiler warnings fix.
    
    2011-04-15  Thomas Adam <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* NEWS:
    	* configure.ac:
    	Updated for the FVWM 2.6.0 stable release.
    
    2011-04-10    <despen@verizon.net>
    	* fvwm/fvwm.c (SetRCDefaults): Add fvwm-menu-desktop to built in menu.
    
    2011-04-10  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* acinclude.m4:
    	* configure.ac:
    	More --as-needed ld fixes for linking against exernal libraries.
    
    2011-04-05  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/update.c (apply_window_updates):
    	Don't clear all States on WindowStyle.
    
    2011-04-02  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	*fvwm/ewmh_conf.c (CMD_EwmhBaseStruts):
    	Use EWMH_UpdateWorkArea() and not separate function calls
    
    	Don't assume the work of EWMH_UpdateWorkArea() will only ever call two
    	function calls by itself in the future; hence, centralise the call to
    	doing that to the correct containing function.
    
    2011-02-05  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* acinclude.m4:
    	Fix DSO linker error (ld) with missing "-lfontconfig" for fontconfig
    
    	Stricter DSO checks with newer Libc versions requires the linker find
    	the symbols elsewhere.  The only one that's missing is "-lfontconfig" as
    	we already supply -lX11 -lXent elsewhere.
    
    2011-03-02  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/events.c (HandleFocusIn):
    	Fix NeverFocus windows when handling FocusIn events.
    
    	Certain button presses on client windows can trigger a FocusIn event on
    	the parent (such as opening a menu on a GTK application).  Disallow the
    	click to trigger the window receiving focus, as well as redrawing the
    	border to reflect the window has focus.
    
    2011-02-14  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* libs/PictureImageLoader.c (PImageLoadPng):
    	Use png_get_color_type() as the data type we were previously using is
    	now no longer public (Finfo_ptr->color_type).  This is in libpng 1.5 --
    	hopefully no need for an #ifdef.
    
    2010-12-19  Thomas Adam  <thomas@fvwm.org>
    	* fvwm/builtins.c (CMD_CursorMove):
    	Honour EdgeScroll settings to not flip pages when EdgeScroll is
    	disabled.
    
    2010-12-04    <despen@verizon.net>
    
    	* fvwm/ConfigFvwmSetup: Better colors in menus and active frames.
    
    2010-11-12  Dominik Vogt  <dominik(dot)vogt(at)gmx(dot)de>
    	* fvwm/placement.c (__place_get_placement_flags):
    	fix reporting of placement reason with nousposition style.
    
    2010-10-09  Dominik Vogt  <dominik(dot)vogt(at)gmx(dot)de>
    
    	* fvwm/events.c (__handle_cr_on_client):
    	fix resize of shaded windows with a shade direction that does not match
    	the window gravity
    
    	* libs/gravity.h:
    	* libs/gravity.c (__gravity_override_one_axis):
    	(gravity_override_dir):
    	new helper functions
    
    	* libs/gravity.c (gravity_combine_xy_dir):
    	fixed calculation with only one axis set
    
    2010-09-16  Sergey Vlasov <vsu@altlinux.ru>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (GetOnePositionArgument):
    	Fix parsing of commands like 'Move 50-50w 50-50w'.
    
    2010-08-31  Gerard Vermeulen <gav451@gmail.org>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (GetOnePositionArgument):
    	Parse commands like 'Move w+-5p w+-2p'.

    	* fvwm/update.c (apply_window_updates):

    	Copy over State settings on WindowStyle command.
    
    	When merging/updating style hints for recaptured windows, ensure we
    	preserve any State hints set on the window.
    
    2010-05-22  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* fvwm/windowlist.c (CMD_WindowList):
    	* NEWS:
    	When reporting on a window's width and height ensure we use the
    	orig_hints XSizeHints struct for calculating resize increment
    	geometries.

    2010-04-28  Dan Espen  <dane@mk.telcordia.com>
    	* fvwm/colorset.c (parse_colorset): Remove bogus error message.
    
    2010-04-24  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* libs/Fpng.h:
    	Define version checks for conditional macros.
    
    	libpng 1.4.0 has different macros for previous version of the same
    	macros in libong 1.2.0, so check for them here.
    
    2010-04-18  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* libs/charmap.c (charmap_table_to_string):
    	Don't allow incremental matching of C_ALL for contexts.
    
    	When printing out bindings, ensure we allow "A" for any/all
    	contexts/modifiers to be matched exactly, so that the context column for
    	bindings matches with what the user put in their config file.
    
    2010-04-03  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* NEWS:
    	* configure.ac:
    	Updated for the FVWM 2.5.29 release.
    
    2010-04-03  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* libs/Fplay.h:
    	Cull unused functions when compiling against librplay.
    
    	When compiling with -Werror, ensure we're not trying to use unneeded
    	librplay static functions we ourselves declare.
    
    2010-04-03  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* fvwm/placement.c (__pl_minoverlap_get_pos_penalty):
    	Tweak placement calculation for over-zealous windows.
    
    	Don't adjust a window's position unless it's actually greater than the
    	screen's dimension (i.e., potentially placed off screen.)
    
    	2010-03-30  Christoph Fritz <chf.fritz@googlemail.com>
    	* fvwm/windowlist.c (CMD_WindowList):
    	Free allocated memory.
    
    2010-02-28  Thomas Adam <thomas@xteddy.org>
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (__resize_step):
    	Don't explicitly send MotionNotify event during Resize (GeometryWindow)
    
    	When calling DisplaySize() from a resize event performed on a window,
    	ensure we use the window's last event (which will be MotionNotify
    	anyway) otherwise this completely confuses the GeometryWindow as it has
    	to then update itself each time.
    
    	When using Xinerama/TwinView, the effect is that the GeometryWindow
    	flickers and/or displays itself on the opposite screen to where the
    	pointer is, because the x/y positions don't take into account the
    	location of the pointer from the original hand-crafted event, but are
    	correct from the execute context the window being resized is called in.
    
    2010-02-06  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/style.c (check_window_style_change):
    	* fvwm/update.c (apply_window_updates):
    	* fvwm/update.h:
    	Propagate Layer changes via Style command on-the-fly.
    
    	Until there's a distinction between initially-mapped styles and runtime
    	commands, and that currently, Style commands take effect immediately,
    	ensure that for any Layer requests received via Style commands, these
    	too are applied immediately.
    
    	The previous assumption was that this was only applicable when mapping a
    	new window, but goes against expectations from the user.
    
    2010-01-07  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/read.c (run_command_file):
    	Restructure how we look for Read files slightly.
    
    	When searching for files with the Read command, check to see if the file
    	first of all has an absolute path and if so open it.  If it's relative
    	then search for it in either FVWM_USERDIR or FVWM_DATADIR as before.  If
    	the file still can't be found, try and open it outright.  This will
    	allow therefore:
    
    	../../some_file
    
    	as a valid filename -- of course this really only makes sense when
    	invoking fvwm with "-f" on the command-line, as relative paths to config
    	files in this way should be built up using "$."
    
    2010-01-05  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/menustyle.c (menustyle_copy_face):
    	Fix segfault setting MenuFace pixmap style for menus.
    
    	As with the tearoff bug from 2010-01-03, ensure we don't try and free a
    	non-existent pixmap from an invalid pointer.
    
    2010-01-05  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/read.c (run_command_file):
    	Fix opening of files to Read/PipeRead to accept absolute paths.
    
    	Don't just assume "/" is a valid identifier for opening files.  "./" is
    	just as likely.  Fixes use-case of:
    
    	fvwm -f ./some_fvwm2rc
    
    2010-01-04  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/events.c (flush_property_notify):
    	Add atom to struct so it is checked for by test_typed_window_event().
    
    2010-01-04  David Fries <David@Fries.net>
    	* fvwm/events.c (test_typed_window_event):
    	* fvwm/events.c (flush_property_notify):
    	Efficiently handle flushing property events of the same type.
    
    	* fvwm/events.h (test_typed_window_event_args):
    	Add XAtom type to struct.
    
    2010-01-04  David Fries <David@Fries.net>
    	* fvwm/virtual.c (HandlePaging):
    	Move no page detect check, it wasn't being hit.
    	* fvwm/move_resize.c (__move_loop):
    	Transform window position to pointer position and back when calling
    	HandlePaging.
    
    2010-01-03  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/menustyle.c (menustyle_copy_face):
    	Fix segfault when creating a tearoff menu using a Pixmap background.
    
    	When we copy the original menustyle to the new torn-off menu which
    	contains a background image, don't then update the menu's pixel
    	background color, as this is already free()d for us by an earlier copy
    	call.
    
    2009-12-31  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/builtins.c (CMD_BugOpts):

    	Qt windows handle having ClientMessage events sent to them.
    
    2009-12-30  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/placement.c (__pl_minoverlap_get_pos_penalty):
    	Fix y-axis offset calculations when using MinOverlapPlacement, by
    	forcing the window on-screen when over-zealous penality calculations
    	don't take into account the size of the window borders.
    
    2009-12-26  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>

    2009-12-12  Thomas Adam <thomas.adam22@gmail.com>
    	* fvwm/fvwm.c (StartupStuff):
    	Reset the state of the "Restarting" flag to False when restarting FVWM.
    
    	* fvwm/events.c (HandleMapRequestKeepRaised):
    	Only run InitialMapCommand when FVWM isn't restarting and all windows
    	have been recaptured.  The window is already mapped by the time FVWM is
    	restarting, and running the InitialMapCommand again only serves to
    	"toggle" the window state (c.f. InitialMapCommand Iconic, etc.)

    Fix segfault when creating a tearoff menu using a Pixmap background.
    
    When we copy the original menustyle to the new torn-off menu which
    contains a background image, don't then update the menu's pixel
    background color, as this is already free()d for us by an earlier copy
    call in menustyle_copy().

    Only allocate those variables on the stack where they're needed -- make
    everything else belong on the heap.  Furthermore, fix segfault in
    fvwm/bindings.c:print_bindings() when performing strlen on unallocated

    the parts causing the problem.

    Fixed bug installing FvwmCommand in bindir (can't access Jitterbug
    right now to find the number).
