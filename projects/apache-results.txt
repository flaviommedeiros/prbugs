    * Fix another memory leak related to PR 44026. Now that we keep the connection

Author: Chris Darroch <chrisd@apache.org>

    We now create memory sub-pools for each DB connection and close DB
    connections in a pool cleanup function.  This simplifies the ap_dbd_acquire()
    and ap_dbd_cacquire() functions, and also stops us from leaking ap_dbd_t
    structures when using reslists.
    
    We ensure that prepared statements are destroyed before their DB connection
    is closed, in case any drivers would have problems cleaning up prepared
    statements after the DB connection is closed.
    
    The combination of reslists and memory pool cleanup functions was causing
    segfaults when child processes exited, as reported in PR 39985.  To prevent
    this, we register dbd_destroy() as a cleanup that will execute prior to
    the internal cleanup function registered by apr_reslist_create().  When the
    reslist's memory pool is destroyed, dbd_destroy() informs dbd_destruct() not
    to do anything when subsequently called by the reslist's internal cleanup
    function.
    
    We avoid the use of s->process->pool (the global pool) since it isn't
    destroyed by exiting child processes in most multi-process MPMs.

    r475920, r475922, r476600, r437668 from trunk, which makes mod_deflate.c the
    same as r483597 from trunk:
    
    All comments to these changes for the sake of completeness:
    
    * Fix wrong FLUSH bucket handling in deflate_out_filter: Actually the internal
      structures of libz never got flushed as ctx->stream.avail_in is always zero
      here. As the EOS and the FLUSH bucket case use the same code for flushing
      libz's internal buffers move this code to the new function flush_zlib_buffer.
    
    * Fix potential memory leaks in deflate_out_filter if bailing out due to an
      error (either in the lower filter chain or during a libz operation). We need
      to call deflateEnd as it is very likely that this filter is never called
      again to ensures that libz's internal structures get cleaned properly.
    
    * Remove ourselves from the filter chain if we failed to init libz, as we
      pass data down the filter chain uncompressed afterwards.
    
    * In preparation of the changes of the inflate out filter:
      - rename flush_zlib_buffer to flush_libz_buffer (this name seems
        better)
      - add a parameter to tell flush_libz_buffer whether it should
        deflate or inflate as this function should be also used for the
        inflate out filter.
    
    * This shortcut is too short. It is not up to the filters to decide
      whether filters down the chain can do something useful with this empty
      brigade.
    
    * Initialize zRC to avoid a compiler warning.
    
    * Rather use a pool cleanup function than calling deflateEnd before every
      return from function to ensure that libz's internals get cleaned up.
    
    * Add parameter crc to flush_libz_buffer in order to call the libz's crc32
      function on the output buffer if needed. This is actually needed by the
      later rework of the inflate out filter.
    
    * Use a define for the number of validation bytes (CRC and length) after the
      compressed data
    
    * We can ignore Z_BUF_ERROR in flush_libz_buffer because:
      When we call libz_func we can assume that
    
       - avail_in is zero (due to the surrounding code that calls
         flush_libz_buffer)
       - avail_out is non zero due to the fact that we just emptied
         the output buffer and stored it into a brigade
    
      So the only reason for Z_BUF_ERROR is that the internal libz
      buffers are now empty and thus we called libz_func one time
      too often. This does not hurt. It simply says that we are done.
    
    * some optimizations taken from the inflate out filter
    
    * Remove bogus code that chokes on flush buckets
    
    * Rework inflate out filter and give it a similar workflow as the deflate out
      filter. This fixes the following bugs in the inflate out filter:
    
      - Incorrect handling of flush buckets.
      - Excessive memory usage for large compressed content (because we now
        already sent parts down the chain and do not process the whole brigade
        first before sending something down the chain).
      - Handle the case correctly where the validation bytes at the end of
        the compressed data stream are distributed across different buckets /
        brigades.
      - Fix a memory leak due to not cleaning up the internal structures of
        libz in some error cases.
    
    * Ensure that we do not try to inflate validation data or garbage data. None
      of this is zlib's business.
    
    * Ensure that we do not perform our final operations twice if a second EOS
      falls down the chain by accident. Otherwise we are likely to run in a
      SEGFAULT. So remove ourselves from the chain.
    
    * Actually append new data to the validation buffer and do not overwrite old
      data already there by setting the correct offset for the target buffer.
    
    * Also log the presence of garbage data at the end of the stream if all
      validation data is available in the first round.
    
    * Housekeeping: keep track of size even in the edge-case where validation
      bytes trickle in over multiple buckets.

    Don't try to use the LDAP cache if it has been turned off.  Make sure that we
    have a "curl" before trying to use it.  If caching has been turned off then the
    curl variable will be NULL.  This fixes a problem where LDAP caching would
    fault when caching was disabled.
    
    This also fixes some memory leaks due to not freeing resources when error
    conditions occur.

    	Add notes about memory leaks found by David Harris.  It's
    	unclear (to me, at least) how severe they are, but the
    	module counters are involved and long-running servers with regularly
    	scheduled restarts *could* be vulnerable..?

    Igor found a memory leak -- we're allocating the initial request_rec in
    the connection pool rather than creating a new pool first.  So each
    request on a keepalive connection would waste sizeof(request_rec).

    sizeof(int) < sizeof(long) due to inappapriate casting;
    
        * Change "MIN( (int) a, (int) b)" to "(int) MIN(a, b)". As 'a' is the buffer
          size, it will be smaller than any long which overflows an int.
    
        * More generally - change ap_bread and ap_bwrite to defend against a negative

    Correctly return 413 when an invalid chunk size is given on input.
    
    - If get_chunk_size() returns a negative number, that probably implies
      an overflow.  So, create a 413 error and pass it to the output filters.
    - Modify ap_discard_request_body() to return OK quickly if we're a subreq
      or our status code implies that we will be dropping the connection.
    - Modify ap_die() so that if the new status implies that we will drop
      the connection, that we correctly indicate that we can not keepalive
      this connection.  (Without this, the error is returned, but the connection
      is not closed.)

    A modification to reduce the memory usage of the server:
    Reduced the initial size of the r->headers_in and r->subprocess_env
    tables...this saves us 600 bytes per request, which (based on tests
    I just ran) helps keep r->pool from overflowing its initial 8KB
    allocation and having to alloc another 8KB block.

    Oh, don't you love buffer overflows?
    We need to allocate storage space for the terminating NULL AND the extra /
    we may tack on to the string at some point.
    
    How in the hell the stars were aligned for this to corrupt newv via the
    strcat at line 580 is unknown.

    if we're gonna trash the connection due to a queue overflow, at the
    very least we should close the socket and write a log message (mostly
    to aid debugging, as this is a showstopper problem)
    
    this is no fix; there is a design issue to consider; hopefully this
    will

    Fix possible buffer overflow situation in suexec.c.
    
    PS: The PR#2790 provides a few more fixes for problematic
        things in suexec.c. Because we have to be very carefully here, other
        should review them, too. That's why I commit only some of the fixes from
        this patch.
    
        The other problem we _really_ have to fix is the docroot-check at line
        428. But here the patch from the PR submitter seems to introduce a new
        problem: It accesses cwd[dlen] which can be out of memory bounds. Here
        memory bounds have to checked first.
    
        So, I would appreciate when someothers look at PR#2790, please.  At least
        the docroot-check _has_ to be fixed by us! But correctly, i.e. without
        introducing new problems, of course ;_)

    Make sure the returned value of rand() is not greater then RAND_MAX on systems
    like SunOS where we guessed the RAND_MAX value. This the way Ben requested but
    without the "+1" because this actually leaded to an overflow warning under
    compiletime and is not really needed because this is random number generating
    functions where it doesn't count because of the additional bounding checks.
    I've tested it now under FreeBSD 2.1.5 _and_ SunOS 4.1.3 and it both correctly
    gives numbers between 1 and N when run with l=1 and h=N. Nothing more is
    needed....

    Reduce what is written by aplog_error() by excluding filename if it
    is NULL, line number if it is "-", and errno if the new APLOG_NOERRNO bit
    is set in level parameter.  Do it all with a lot less string copying --
    use snprintf incrementally to build up the entire buffer.
    When server_conf is NULL use stderr, since that is necessary to do some
    things during startup and other odd cases (i.e. SEGV).
    Fixed a buffer overflow with syslog stuff using sprintf().
