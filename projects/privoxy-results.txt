    - non-standard-dir-perm /var/log/privoxy 0744

    privoxy-2.9.14-1
    - Changes to fixate the uid and gid values as (both) 73. This is a value we
        hope to standarize for all distributions. RedHat already uses it, and
        Conectiva should start as soon as I find where the heck I left my
        cluebat :-)
    - Only remove the user and group on uninstall if this is not redhat, once
        redhat likes to have the values allocated even if the package is not

        improved I mean: we do it by brute force now. Much easier to maintain.
        Yeah, you got it right. No more Mr. Nice Guy.
    - Removed the userdel call on %post. No need, once it's complety handled on
        the %pre section

    - Changes description to use the new name
    - Sed string was NOT changed. Have to wait to the manpage to change first

        changes on the script (scheduled for the next specfile release)
    - Added post entry to move the old logfile to the new log directory
    - Removing "chkconfig --add" entry (not good to have it automaticaly added

        remove it from the startup list
    - Removed the chkconfig --del entry from the conditional block on the preun

    Sun Jun 03 2001 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org>
    - rework of RPM
    Mon Sep 25 2000 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org>
    - CLF Logging patch by davep@cyw.uklinux.net
    - Hal DeVore <haldevore@earthling.net> fix akamaitech in blocklist
    Sun Sep 17 2000 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org>
    - Steve Kemp skx@tardis.ed.ac.uk's javascript popup patch.
    - Markus Breitenbach breitenb@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de supplied
        numerous fixes and enhancements for Steve's patch.
    - adamlock@netscape.com (Adam Lock) in the windows version:
    - Taskbar activity spinner always spins even when logging is turned off
        (which is the default) - people who don't like the spinner can turn it
        off from a menu option.
    - Taskbar popup menu has a options submenu - people can now open the
        settings files for cookies, blockers etc. without opening the JB
        window.
    - Logging functionality works again
    - Buffer overflow is fixed - new code uses a bigger buffer and snprintf so
        it shouldn't overflow anymore.
    - Fixed userid swa, group learning problem while installing. root must
        build RPM.
    - Added patch by Benjamin Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au> that prevents JB to
        core dump when there is no log file.
    - Tweaked SuSE startup with the help of mohataj@gmx.net and Doc.B@gmx.de.
    - Fixed man page to include imagefile and popupfile.
    - Sanity check for the statistics function added.
    - "Patrick D'Cruze" <pdcruze@orac.iinet.net.au>: It seems Microsoft are
        transitioning Hotmail from FreeBSD/Apache to Windows 2000/IIS. With
        IIS/5, it appears to omit the trailing \r\n from http header only
        messages. eg, when I visit http://www.hotmail.com, IIS/5 responds with
        a HTTP 302 redirect header. However, this header message is missing the
        trailing \r\n. IIS/5 then closes the connection. Junkbuster,
        unfortunately, discards the header becomes it thinks it is incomplete -
        and it is. MS have transmitted an incomplete header!
    - Added bug reports and patch submission forms in the docs.
    Display of statistics of the total number of requests and the number of
        requests filtered by junkbuster, also the percentage of requests
        filtered. Suppression of the listing of files on the proxy-args page.
        All stuff optional and configurable.
    password@www.foo.com. Fixed.
    Mon Aug 02 1999 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org> Blank images are no
        longer cached, thanks to a hint from Markus Breitenbach
        <breitenb@rbg.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>. The user agent is NO longer
        set by the Junkbuster. Sadly, many sites depend on the correct browser
        version nowadays. Incorporated many suggestions from Jan "Yenya"
        Kasprzak <kas@fi.muni.cz> for the spec file. Fixed logging problem and
        since runlevel 2 does not use networking, I replaced
        /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S84junkbuster with /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/K09junkbuster thanks
        to Shaw Walker <walker@netgate.net>. You should now be able to build
        this RPM as a non-root user (mathias@weidner.sem.lipsia.de).
    Sun Jan 31 1999 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org>
        %{_localstatedir}/log/junkbuster set to nobody. Added
        /etc/junkbuster/imagelist to allow more sophisticated matching of
        blocked images. Logrotate logfile. Added files for auto-updating the
        blocklist et al.
    %{_localstatedir}/lock/subsys/junkbuster. More regexps in the blocklist.
        Prepared the forwardfile for squid. Extended image regexp with help
        from gabriel <somlo@CS.ColoState.EDU>.
    Thu Nov 19 1998 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org> All RPMs now identify
        themselves in the show-proxy-args page. Released Windoze version. Run
        junkbuster as nobody instead of root.
    Fri Oct 30 1998 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org> Newest version. First
        release (hence the little version number mixture -- 2.0.2-0 instead of
        2.0-7). This version tightens security over 2.0.1; some multi-user
        sites will need to change the listen-address in the configuration file.
        The blank version of the Internet Junkbuster has a more sophisticated
        way of replacing images. All RPMs identify themselves in the
        show-proxy-args page.
    Wed Sep 23 1998 Stefan Waldherr <stefan@waldherr.org> Modified the blocking
        feature, so that only GIFs and JPEGs are blocked and replaced but not
        HTML pages. Thanks to "Gerd Flender" <plgerd@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
        for this nice idea. Added numerous stuff to the blocklist. Keep patches
        in seperate files and no longer in diffs (easier to maintain).
    Tue Jun 16 1998 Stefan Waldherr <swa@cs.cmu.edu> Moved config files to
        /etc/junkbuster directory, moved man page, added BuildRoot directive
        (Thanks to Alexey Nogin <ayn2@cornell.edu>) Made new version
        junkbuster-raw (which is only a stripped version of the junkuster rpm,
        i.e. without my blocklist, etc.)
    I changed the default user agent to Linux -- no need anymore to support
        Apple.
    Tue Jun 16 1998 (2.0-0) Now-less-ads-than-ever (SM) compiled with gcc
        instead of cc compiled with -O3, thus it should be a little faster
        show-proxy-args now works /etc/junkbuster.init wasn't necessary
    //www.waldherr.org/junkbuster/ for further info.
    Tue Jun 16 1998 (1.3) The program has been moved to /usr/sbin (from
        /usr/local/bin) Init- and stopscripts (/etc/rc.d/rc*) have been added
        so that the junkbuster starts automatically during bootup. The
        /etc/blocklist file is much more sophisticated. Theoretically one
        should e.g. browse all major US and German newspapers without seeing
        one annoying ad. junkbuster.init was modified. It now starts junkbuster
        with an additional "-r @" flag.
