    (AC_PREREQ): Bump to 2.60.
    (AC_INIT): Bump version to 1.3.6.
    (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR): New.
    (AC_CONFIG_HEADERS): Move config.h to lib.

    (gl_EARLY, gl_INIT): New.
    match.c was moved to lib/match.c.
    (AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE): Replace AC_CHECK_HEADERS.  Don't check
    for sys/utime.h or utime.h.
    (AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE): Replace AC_CHECK_FUNCS.  Check for fchmod
    and fchown, not utime.
    (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove; rpmatch is now done by gnulib.
    (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add doc/Makefile, lib/Makefile.
    
    * bits.c: Use the more-usual form for copyright notices in source code.
    * deflate.c: Likewise.
    * gzip.c: Likewise.
    * gzip.h: Likewise.
    * inflate.c: Likewise.
    * lzw.h: Likewise.
    * revision.h: Likewise.
    * tailor.h: Likewise.
    * trees.c: Likewise.
    * unpack.c: Likewise.
    * unzip.c: Likewise.
    * util.c: Likewise.
    * crypt.c (dummy): Add decl so that pedantic compilers won't
    complain about an empty file.
    * gzip.c (license_msg): Use more-modern wording.
    Include fcntl-safer.h, openat.h, stat-macros.h, stat-time.h.
    Simply include <dirent.h> if !NO_DIR, removing a rats-nest of
    #ifdefs.
    Simply include <utimens.h> if !defined NO_UTIME, removing a
    another rats-nest of #ifdefs.
    (DIR_OPT, TIME_OPT): Remove.
    (_D_EXACT_NAMLEN): Renamed from NAMLEN.  All uses changed.
    (S_ISDIR, S_ISREG, O_BINARY, O_CREAT, O_EXCL, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR):
    Remove; gnulib now does this.
    (RETSIGTYPE): Remove; Autoconf does this.
    (program_name): Renamed from progname, for compatibility with gnulib.
    All uses changed.
    (time_stamp): Now struct timespec, not time_t.  All uses changd.
    (remove_oftime): Now volatile.
    (reset_times): Remove; now done by futimens.
    (usage): Remove.
    (try_help): New function.
    (help, license): Don't output date as part of version.
    A version number suffices.
    (help): Redo help message to match style of coreutils etc.
    (version): Don't bother printing compile-time configuration info
    like STDC_HEADERS.
    (main): Don't assume strlen (argv[0]) < INT_MAX (!).
    On usage errors, suggest --help without outputting all the help.
    (main, do_list): Remove unnecessary casts.
    (treat_stdin, treat_file, get_method, copy_stat):
    Support sub-second time stamp resolution.
    (treat_file, copy_istat): Close some race conditions if files are
    renamed as we read or write them.
    (treat_file): Do not attempt to reset the access times of
    directories that we read.
    (open_and_stat, open_input_file): New functions.
    (do_stat, get_istat): Remove; most of the contents went to these new
    functions.
    (make_ofname): Don't use WARN, as it affects exit status.
    (get_method): When the original file name was truncated,
    restore from its base name, not from its full name.
    (do_list): Avoid undefined behavior with out-of-range time stamps.
    ctime, for example, cannot be invoked on arbitrary time stamps safely,
    since it might overrun an internal buffer.  Do not assume that
    localtime succeeds.
    (copy_stat): Do not remove input file; that's now the caller's
    responsibility.  This avoids a problem if there is a write error
    when the caller closes the output file.
    (treat_dir): New arg FD, to avoid a race condition.  All uses changed.
    (remove_output_file): New function.
    (abort_gzip): Use it.
    (abort_gzip_signal): New function, which is async-signal-safe.
    Exit with the signal that we got.
    * gzip.h (program_name, time_stamp, abort_gzip): Adjust decls to
    match gzip.c changes.
    * inflate.c (huft_build): Return 2 if null input.
    * tailor.h (HAVE_UTIME): Do not define; gnulib does this now.
    (OPEN): Use open_safer, not plain open.
    * unlzh.c (NPT): Set to 1<<TBIT, not to the maximum of NT and NP.
    (make_table): Report an error if 1<<tablebits < nextcode.
    (read_pt_len): Report an error if 16 < c.
    * unpack.c (read_tree): Report an error if the tree has too many
    leaves while reading it.  Fix off-by-one error in final check.
    * util.c: Include <xalloc.h>, for xalloc_die decl.
    (gzip_base_name): Renamed from base_name, so we don't collide
    with gnulib.  All uses changed.
    (add_envopt): Use xstrdup instead of xmalloc+strcpy.
    Use xcalloc rather than calloc + check.
    (gzip_error): Renamed from error, so we don't collide with gnulib.
    All uses changed.
    (xalloc_die): New function.
    (xmalloc): Remove; no longer needed.
    * zip.c (zip): Watch for time stamp overflow; the old code
    mishandled negative time stamps.
    
    * gzexe.in: Add support for --help, --version, --.
    Don't call basename or sed if we can avoid it.
    * zdiff.in: Likewise.
    * zforce.in: Likewise.
    * zgrep.in: Likewise.
    * zless.in: Likewise.
    * zmore.in: Likewise.
    * znew.in: Likewise.
    * zdiff.in: Protect against file names beginning with "-".
    * zmore.in: Likewise.
    * zgrep.in: Use printf rather than echo, to avoid problems with
    leading "-" and backslash.  Return status of subsidiary grep.
    * zless.in: Add copyright notice.
    
    * zless.1: We now pass "--" to LESSOPEN.
    (BUGS): Mention that input file arguments are required.
    Add copyright notice.
    
    * COPYING: Update to current version.
    
    * Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): New macro.
    (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove; now done in configure.ac.
    (M4DIR, ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): Remove.
    (EXTRA_DIST): Remove getopt.h.
    (gzip_SOURCES): Remove getopt.c, getopt1.c, yesno.c.
    (gzip_LDADD): Change from @LIBOBJS@ to lib/libgzip.a.
    (AM_MAKEINFOFLAGS, info_TEXINFOS, gzip_TEXINFOS, ASCPP, LN_S):
    (match.$(OBJEXT)): Move to subdirectory makefiles.
    (.in): Substitute @VERSION@, too.
    (check-local): New rule.
    (MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Add _match.S.
    
    * doc/gzip.texi: Renamed from gzip.texi.  Change to GNU FDL
    without invariant sections or cover texts.  Don't put
    version number or date into sample gzip -h output.
    * lib/match.c: Renamed from match.c.  Add ia64 version
    written by Sverre Jarp (HP Labs).
    
    * INSTALL: Remove from CVS; now created automatically by
    the bootstrap script.

    * aclocal.m4: Likewise.

    * rpmatch.c: Likewise.
    * stamp-vti: Likewise.
    * texinfo.tex: Likewise.
    * version.texi: Likewise.
